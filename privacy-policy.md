## Information We Collect

We collect minimal, non-personal data to improve app performance and ensure a smooth user experience:

- **Usage Analytics**: We log anonymous usage events (such as when a user taps the "Start Trial" button) to help us improve features and debug issues. These analytics are non-personal and do not include your notes or any private content.

---

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected data strictly for the following purposes:

- **Debugging & Stability**: To identify issues and improve reliability.
- **Feature Improvement**: Understanding how users interact with specific features helps us improve them.

---

## Data Sharing

We **do not share** any of your personal data or note content with third parties.

- We use **Firebase Analytics** to collect anonymous app usage data (e.g. feature taps).
- Firebase does **not** access your notes or store personal content.

---

## Data Storage and Retention

- **Your Notes**: All notes are stored **locally on your device**. We do not collect or store them on any server.
- **Analytics Events**: Anonymous events (like button taps) are processed by Firebase and retained temporarily by Firebase, according to their analytics policy.


---

## Local Notes

Your notes are fully private and stored on your own device.  
You can permanently delete them at any time from within the app.  
We never access, transmit, or store your notes.

---

## Your Rights

You have full control over your personal content:

- **Delete Notes**: You can delete your notes at any time within the app.
- **Analytics**: Since analytics are anonymous, no personal deletion is necessary.
- **Contact Us**: Email us anytime with questions or concerns at i3arty.dev@gmail.com.

## Security

We take your privacy seriously and use industry-standard measures to protect your information.  
We do not store your notes or personal data in the cloud.

Only anonymous app events (like button taps) are sent securely to Firebase Analytics to improve app performance.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Memori Note is **not intended for children under the age of 13**.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it immediately.
